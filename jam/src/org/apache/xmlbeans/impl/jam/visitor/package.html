    Provides a framework for traversing a JElement tree and possibly
    modifying its contents.  Also includes ElementVisitor implementations
    which encapsulate standard JClass initialization behaviors, such as
    comment parsing and JProperty identification.

  <p>
    Customized ElementVistors can be written to modify or extend such
    behaviors.  See JamServiceParams for details on how to plug in
    such extensions.
